# compress-pdf 📄

A simple GUI tool to **recursively compress PDF files** in a selected folder using [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/).

Designed to be easy to run for non-technical users while remaining fully scriptable and reproducible via `conda`.

Tested on **Windows**, should work on **Linux** and **macOS** as well. 🤞

## ⚡ Quick setup (conda)

1. 📥 Install [`miniforge`](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild/blob/master/doc/install-miniforge.md)

2. 🛠️ Create the environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

3. ▶️ Activate it:
   ```bash
   conda activate compress-pdf
   ```

4. 🔄 (Later) Update the environment:

   ```bash
   conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
   ```

The [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) installs:

* 🐍 Python
* 📄 Ghostscript
* 📦 the local package (via `pip`), so the `compress-pdf` console command is registered

## ▶️ Run

After activating the environment launch the GUI:

```bash
compress-pdf
```

## 🚀 Ready-to-use launcher scripts

Launcher scripts allow starting the app without manually activating the environment.

⚙️ Generate launchers:

```bash
conda activate compress-pdf
python scripts/make_launcher.py
```

### 🪟 Windows

* Use `run_compress_pdf.cmd`
* Double-click or run from a terminal

### 🐧 Linux / 🍎 macOS

* Use `run_compress_pdf.sh`
* The generator marks it executable
* If needed:

```bash
chmod +x run_compress_pdf.sh
```

## ⚙️ Ghostscript notes

* 🪟 **Windows**: expected executable is `gswin64c.exe`
* 🐧 **Linux / macOS**: binary is usually `gs`

The conda environment installs `ghostscript` automatically.
Alternatively, a system installation can be used and selected from the GUI if needed.
